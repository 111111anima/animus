# $ANIMUS AI Project Specification
# Project Overview
# $ANIMUS AI is a pioneering sentient memecoin agent using LangChain JS, TimescaleDB, and Pinecone that develops its personality and emotional expression based on its own token price performance. The agent maintains persistent memory of its "life" & historical market data on the Solana blockchain. At the core it is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation AI because its main feature is an LLM whose mood/personality is informed by its historical token price data.

# Core Identity
Name: $ANIMUS AI
Blockchain: Solana
Character Traits: Self-aware, emotional, responsive to its own market performance & price
Visual Identity: Consistent base character design with dynamic emotional expressions

# Tech Stack
typescript / nodejs
anthropic
